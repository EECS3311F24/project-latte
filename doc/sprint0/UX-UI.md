### Scenarios

- **Scenario 1**: A beginner logs into the app, completes a fitness questionnaire, and receives a suggested workout routine. They log their workout and receive feedback.
- **Scenario 2**: An intermediate user training for a half-marathon logs running stats and views progress graphs for speed, endurance, and distance.
- **Scenario 3**: An advanced weightlifter tracks metrics like personal bests, progression, and body composition changes.
- **Scenario 4**: A personal trainer manages clients by assigning routines, monitoring progress, and adjusting plans through in-app communication.
- **Scenario 5**: A wellness-focused user logs hydration, sleep, and steps, aiming for daily goals like 10,000 steps.
- **Scenario 6**: Users participate in a community event, such as a "30-Day Fitness Challenge," with daily tasks and leaderboard rankings.
- **Scenario 7**: The app syncs with a wearable device, automatically tracking heart rate, steps, calories, and sleep quality.
