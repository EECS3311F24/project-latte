# **Process**

Our team collaborated primarily through a Discord server. We utilized this platform to discuss our group name, brainstorm project ideas, project tasks, and upcoming deadlines.

To decide on our project app, we created a poll in Discord, allowing each team member to vote on their preferred ideas. Based on the poll, we collectively decided to develop a fitness app.

We made a list of approximately 30 user stories, each representing a feature of our app. Using Discord's polling feature again, which allows for a maximum of 55 choices, we included all 30 user stories for our initial vote. The stories that received no votes were subsequently removed from the next poll. We repeated this voting process until we narrowed our list down to the final 20 user stories that we felt best represented our appâ€™s functionality.

In addition to polls, we held remote meetings using Discord voice calls. During these meetings, we delegated tasks among team members, ensuring that everyone was clear about their responsibilities and deadlines.


# **Lessons for the Next Phase**

**Documentation:** Keep a record of discussions and decisions made during meetings. Also document changes made to the project no matter how big or small. This will serve as a reference and help maintain clarity among team members and project progress.

**Foster Open Communication:** Encourage all team members to share their thoughts and suggestions freely to create an environment that values different ideas.

By implementing these lessons, we aim to improve our collaboration and efficiency as we move into the next phase of our project.
