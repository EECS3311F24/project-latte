3. Sprint Goal
Objective: The primary goal of Sprint 1 is to establish the foundation of the fitness app by setting up backend infrastructure, implementing user authentication with Clerk, developing initial frontend layouts, and integrating the exercise API.
Expected Outcome: By the end of this sprint, the team will have a functioning backend, user registration and login via Clerk, initial frontend layouts, and API connectivity to fetch exercises based on muscle groups.
Sprint Goal:
To build the backend infrastructure, enable user authentication, design basic frontend layouts, and connect to the external exercise API for foundational functionality.

5. User Stories for Sprint 1
The following user stories have been prioritized for completion in this sprint to meet the MVP requirements:

User Story 001: As a new user, I want to register with my email and password using Clerk so that I can create an account.
User Story 002: As a registered user, I want to log in securely with my credentials to access my workout data.
User Story 003: As a user, I want to set up and manage my profile details.
User Story 004: As a user, I want to browse exercises by muscle group to find suitable exercises.
User Story 009: As a user, I want the app to have a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface.
User Story 010: As a user, I want the layout to adjust to my screen size for an optimal viewing experience.
5. Decisions on User Stories and Spikes
User Authentication: The team will use Clerk for user registration and login to simplify authentication and enhance security.
Exercise API: The app will connect to an external API for exercise data, initially focusing on filtering exercises by muscle group.
Frontend Design: Basic layouts will be designed using a Tailwind CSS-inspired approach for a clean, responsive look.
Spikes Identified:
Spike 1: Research best practices for integrating Clerk authentication securely.
Spike 2: Investigate API rate limiting to ensure exercise data loads efficiently.
