### Practices to Continue in Next Sprint

- **Frequent Standups**: Having standups helped the team stay aligned and identify blockers early on.
- **Clear Task Assignments**: Each team member knew their responsibilities, reducing confusion.
- **Check-ins**: These allowed us to recap the teams' and adjust as needed.

### New Practices to Consider for Next Sprint

- **More Frequent Code Reviews**: Increase code review sessions to ensure early detection of issues.
- **Time-Boxed Task Management**: Add stricter timeboxing for tasks to manage workload and progress more effectively.
- **Sprint Planning with Smaller Task Breakdown**: Breaking down tasks into smaller sub-tasks might prevent tasks from rolling over into the next sprint.
- **Review Grading Criteria Early**: Read and understand the grading criteria at the beginning of the sprint to align tasks accordingly, rather than reviewing what has been done and adjusting to fit the grading later.

### Practices to Stop Using in Next Sprint

- **Last-Minute Merging**: Avoid rushing merges near the sprintâ€™s end, as it led to unforeseen issues.
- **Skipping Documentation Updates**: Ensure every completed task includes updated documentation in Github to avoid last-minute inconsistencies.

### Best/Worst Experiences

- **Best Experience**: Successfully implementing the workout logging feature prototype; the team felt accomplished and well-coordinated.
- **Worst Experience**: Struggles with dependency issues in the Expo setup, leading to delays and task rollovers into the next sprint.
