1. Introduction
This document provides an overview of the system design for the Fitness App, detailing the architecture, main classes and their responsibilities, interactions, and error-handling strategies. This initial design may evolve over time to accommodate new features or integrate improved solutions.

2. CRC Cards
Class: User
Responsibilities:
Register and log in users using Clerk.
Manage user session information.
Retrieve and update user profile information.
Collaborations:
AuthenticationService: For validating user credentials.
Profile: For storing and managing user-specific data.
Class: Profile
Responsibilities:
Store user profile data (e.g., name, email).
Enable user updates to profile information.
Collaborations:
User: Owned by a single user, interacts with the User class to link profile data.
Database: Saves and retrieves profile data in the backend database.
Class: Workout
Responsibilities:
Add, remove, and manage exercises within a workout plan.
Save and retrieve workout plans for each user.
Collaborations:
Exercise: Uses exercises to build a workout plan.
Database: Interacts with the database for storing and retrieving workout data.
Class: Exercise
Responsibilities:
Display and manage exercise information based on muscle groups.
Store exercise details (e.g., name, target muscle, equipment).
Collaborations:
ExerciseAPIService: Fetches exercise information from an external API.
Workout: Used by the Workout class to add exercises to a workout plan.
Class: ExerciseAPIService
Responsibilities:
Connect to external API to fetch exercise data.
Cache exercise data in the database to reduce repeated API calls.
Collaborations:
Exercise: Supplies exercise data to the Exercise class.
Database: Stores cached exercise data for future access.
Class: AuthenticationService
Responsibilities:
Manage user registration, login, and session validation.
Ensure secure handling of authentication using Clerk.
Collaborations:
User: Verifies and manages user sessions.
Clerk API: Facilitates authentication with Clerk’s service.
3. System Architecture Diagram
The Fitness App architecture follows a three-tier structure consisting of Frontend, Backend, and Database components, with external services for authentication and exercise data.

Explanation:
Frontend:

Platform: React Native.
Purpose: Manages UI and handles user interactions. It makes API requests to the backend to retrieve or modify data.
Backend:

Platform: Node.js with Express.
Purpose: Serves as the main server that handles API requests, processes business logic, and communicates with the database and external services.
Database:

Platform: PostgreSQL.
Purpose: Stores user data, workout plans, and cached exercise data.
External Services:

Clerk API: Manages user authentication and session handling.
Exercise API: Supplies exercise data categorized by muscle group.
4. System Decomposition
Components and Roles:
Frontend:
Handles all user interactions, such as registering, logging in, and creating workout plans.
Sends API requests to the backend and displays data in a user-friendly format.
Backend:
Exposes API endpoints that the frontend interacts with for user, profile, and workout data.
Integrates with Clerk API for authentication and the Exercise API for exercise data.
Database:
Acts as the main repository for all app data, including users, profiles, workouts, and cached exercise details.
Each component serves a distinct purpose, supporting scalability and ease of maintenance. This modular structure also allows for independent updates and testing of each layer.

5. Error Handling and Exception Management
The error-handling strategy for the Fitness App addresses common issues and unexpected exceptions.

Error Categories and Handling Strategy
User Input Errors:

Description: Occur when users enter invalid data.
Handling: Validate inputs on both frontend and backend, displaying user-friendly error messages if necessary.
Authentication Errors:

Description: Related to authentication, such as incorrect credentials.
Handling: Provide clear error messages for incorrect logins and redirect to login on session expiration.
Network and API Errors:

Description: Occur due to network issues or unavailable APIs.
Handling: Display a message to inform the user of connectivity issues and use cached data if available.
Database Errors:

Description: Issues related to accessing or modifying data in the database.
Handling: Retry operations if the database connection is lost and display a generic error if the issue persists.
Unexpected Errors:

Description: Unanticipated errors during runtime.
Handling: Log the errors for the development team and display a generic error message to the user.
Anticipated Response Summary
User Input Errors: “Invalid input. Please check your entries.”
Authentication Errors: “Session expired. Please log in again.”
Network and API Errors: “Network issues detected. Please check your connection.”
Database Errors: “Technical issue encountered. Please try again later.”
Unexpected Errors: “An unexpected error occurred. Please restart the app.”
