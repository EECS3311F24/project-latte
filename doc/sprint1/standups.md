Standup 1 (October 25, 2024)

Team Member: Max Chornenkyy

Yesterday: Finalized the sprint goal and facilitated the Sprint 1 planning meeting. Set up the GitHub repo and assigned initial tasks based on our planning document.
Today: Coordinating team assignments and checking in on initial progress, especially setup tasks like Clerk authentication and API integration.
Blockers: None so far, but tracking potential issues with the Clerk integration for quick support if needed.

Team Member: Vince Flores

Yesterday: Began setting up the Node.js and Express backend environment. Worked on installing dependencies and connecting Clerk for user authentication.
Today: Completing the Clerk authentication setup, including endpoints for user registration and login. Will be testing authentication flows today.
Blockers: Minor delay due to Clerk documentation being unclear in some areas; working through it by referencing community forums.

Team Member: Manille Jao Villacorta

Yesterday: Set up the React Native environment and worked on basic layout components for the login and registration screens.
Today: Continuing to develop the frontend components, focusing on integrating the Clerk authentication flow with React Native. Testing UI elements for responsiveness.
Blockers: Working to ensure smooth integration between Clerk and React Nativeâ€”testing various configurations.


Standup 2 (October 27, 2024)

Team Member: Jiawei Yang

Yesterday: Completed basic setup for connecting the Node.js backend to PostgreSQL. Began writing CRUD operations for handling user profiles.
Today: Continuing with the CRUD operations for user profiles and adding middleware for handling errors. Plan to start initial work on connecting the Exercise API by end of day.
Blockers: None at the moment, but keeping an eye on API rate limiting as a potential future blocker.

Team Member: Subhan Hanif

Yesterday: Familiarized myself with the Clerk setup and basic functionality. Worked on drafting initial test cases for user registration and login.
Today: Writing test scripts for the authentication flows and reviewing the UI setup for responsiveness and compatibility testing. Starting basic UI testing for different screen sizes.
Blockers: None currently, but need more clarity on exercise API integration to start planning test cases for that component.


Standup 3 (October 30, 2024)


Team Member: Max Chornenkyy

Yesterday: Completed the authentication endpoint testing with Clerk. Started work on the API endpoint for fetching exercise data.
Today: Finishing the exercise API endpoint to retrieve and display exercises by muscle group. Will test to ensure data is processed and formatted correctly.
Blockers: API rate limiting is slowing down testing; looking into caching strategies with Subhan.

Team Member: Vince Flores

Yesterday: Completed basic test scripts for login and registration flows. Started testing the profile setup screen.
Today: Testing the exercise browsing functionality and layout. Running tests on the responsiveness of the UI and capturing any bugs for the team.
Blockers: None, but will coordinate with Subhan if any API-related issues arise in the testing environment.

Standup 4 (November 1, 2024)

Team Member: Max Chornenkyy

Yesterday: Conducted a mid-sprint review with the team to assess progress and adjust timelines for any remaining tasks.
Today: Following up on blockers related to API rate limits and caching. Preparing a progress report for stakeholders and coordinating final testing tasks with Jiawei.
Blockers: Minor concern about API performance; team is working on caching solutions.

Team Members: Jiawei Yang + Vince Flores

Yesterday: Implemented caching for the exercise API to minimize rate limit issues. Completed initial testing of the cached API responses.
Today: Testing cache performance and finalizing API integration with the exercise browsing feature. Preparing for additional error-handling improvements.
Blockers: None currently, cache is working well so far.
