## Completed Tasks
Successful Implementation of Personalized Workout Generation and Calorie Counter
During this sprint, we achieved significant progress by completing two major features:

Custom Personalized Workouts Using AI:

## Criteria of Satisfaction Completed:
Implemented an API call that generates custom personalized workout plans using AI based on user's details.
Users can now input their fitness goals, preferences, and personal details to receive tailored workout routines.
Calorie Counter Feature:

## Criteria of Satisfaction Completed:
Developed a calorie counter that allows users to track their daily calorie intake.
Users can input the foods they consume, and the app calculates the total calories to help manage their nutrition effectively.
This progress was made possible by integrating advanced AI technologies and focusing on user-centric nutritional tracking features. The successful implementation enhances the overall functionality and value of our app.

## Practices to Continue in Next Sprint
Effective Integration of Advanced Technologies: Our ability to incorporate AI for personalized workouts demonstrates our technical proficiency and should continue to be a focus.
User-Centric Feature Development: Prioritizing features that directly improve user experience, like the calorie counter, has proven beneficial.
Team Collaboration at Key Moments: Collaborating effectively, especially towards the end of the sprint, enabled us to finalize critical features.

### Next Steps  

Although the project is more or less finished, we can optimize the project by ridding the use of api's, this would save $ in the long run.
